              A full house removal runs from the initial free survey through to furniture
              reassembly at your new address. Our crews handle every step: property survey,
              professional packing, furniture dismantling and wrapping, loading onto a fully
              insured vehicle, transport, unloading and reassembly. Packing waste is collected
              after the move at no extra charge.
            </p>
            <p>
              Coverage extends across all 32 London boroughs, Greater London and Surrey as
              standard. Nationwide relocations follow the same survey-to-settle-in process.
              In 2026 our teams operate seven days a week to fit around completion dates,
              chain timelines and short-notice requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
              London house moves regularly present access challenges that a standard quote
              ignores. Top-floor flats without a lift require a furniture hoist or a stair-carry
              crew with assessed route planning. Narrow Victorian staircases in period properties
              need careful dismantling and measured access work. Parking suspensions are needed
              on most residential streets, and our operations team arranges the borough permit
              as part of move planning.
            </p>
            <p>
              Completion delays and chain breaks create short-notice requirements. Our secure
              24/7 CCTV-monitored storage bridges the gap between moving out and moving in,
              combined with the removal as one managed service.
