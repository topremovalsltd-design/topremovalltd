                Top Removals operates 24/7 CCTV-monitored, fully insured storage in London for
                short-term and long-term requirements. The facility protects your belongings
                during the gap between moving out and moving in, whether that results from a
                completion delay, a chain break, a renovation or a downsizing situation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Short-term storage covers days or weeks for bridging situations. Long-term
                storage suits international moves, property renovations and extended family
                transitions. All units are individually insured and accessed through a
                managed process.
              </p>
              <p>
                A single booking covers the move from your current property, transport to the
                facility and delivery to your new address when you are ready. Storage and
                removal work as one seamless service, not two separate bookings.
