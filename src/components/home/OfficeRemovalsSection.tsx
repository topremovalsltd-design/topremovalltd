              Business relocations in London require planning that protects trading continuity.
              Our commercial removal service covers the full scope: pre-move planning, crate hire
              for sensitive documents and IT equipment, furniture dismantling and reassembly,
              server and desktop computer transport, and out-of-hours or weekend moves that keep
              disruption to a minimum.
            </p>
            <p>
              Crate hire is available as a standalone service or as part of the full office move.
              Plastic lidded crates protect documents and fragile office items more securely than
              cardboard boxes and are delivered to your premises in advance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Weekend and overnight moves ensure your business returns to normal operations by
              Monday morning. For a detailed office relocation plan and a fixed quote, visit our
              office removals and crate hire page.
