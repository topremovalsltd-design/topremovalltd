    question: "How much should I pay for removals in London?",

      "Removal costs in London in 2026 range from approximately [CONFIRM: 1-bed range] for a 1-bedroom flat to [CONFIRM: 3-bed range] for a 3-bedroom house, based on a standard local move within Greater London. The final price depends on access, packing, crew size and parking suspension requirements. Use the cost guide on this page for a full breakdown, or book a free survey for a fixed quote.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is it worth getting a removal company?",
    answer:
      "For full property moves, hiring a professional removal company saves time, reduces the risk of injury and provides insurance cover for your belongings. Van hire is cheaper upfront but places the entire physical and financial risk on you. For smaller single-item moves, a man and van service offers professional-grade cover at a lower cost than a full crew.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the cheapest way to move in London?",
    answer:
      "The cheapest option by upfront cost is van hire, but it excludes goods-in-transit insurance and requires significant physical effort. For insured moves, a man and van service is the lowest-cost professional option for small volumes. For full property moves, getting multiple fixed quotes from BAR-accredited companies ensures competitive pricing with proper cover.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does a removal company do?",
    answer:
      "A removal company packs your belongings, wraps and protects furniture, loads the vehicle, transports everything to your new address and unloads at the destination. Full-service companies also provide packing materials, dismantle and reassemble furniture, arrange parking suspensions and offer storage between moves.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide man and van services?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Our man and van service is available across all London boroughs for small moves, single-item collections, student relocations and short-distance moves. Hourly and fixed-price options are available. Goods-in-transit insurance is included as standard.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer packing and storage?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Full and partial professional packing is available as an add-on to any removal. Secure 24/7 CCTV-monitored storage is available for short-term and long-term needs, with container and household storage options.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are my belongings insured during the move?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Public liability insurance and goods-in-transit insurance are included on every job. If any item is damaged during the move, there is a clear claims process with a financial remedy.",
  },
  {
    question: "What London areas do you cover?",
    answer:
      "Our removal crews cover all 32 London boroughs, Greater London and Surrey as standard. Nationwide and international moves are also covered. Find your local area on our areas page.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you handle parking suspensions and permits?",
