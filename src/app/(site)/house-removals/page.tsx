/* ─────────────── Section 15: FAQs ─────────────── */

const faqs: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    question: "How much does a house removal cost in London?",
    answer:
      "House removal costs in London depend on property size, distance, access and whether packing is included. A studio or 1-bedroom move typically starts from a lower base than a 3 or 4-bedroom house. The most accurate price comes from a free pre-move survey, which accounts for your exact volume, floor level and any parking requirements.",
    answerAfter:
      "Use the removal calculator for an instant estimate, or book a free survey for a fixed written quote with no hidden fees.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is included in a house removal service?",
    answer:
      "A full house removal service includes a pre-move survey, packing (if selected), furniture dismantling, loading, transport, unloading and reassembly at the new address. Parking suspension, appliance disconnection and reconnection are also handled. Optional add-ons include full unpacking, storage and licensed waste disposal.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the cheapest day to move house in London?",
    answer:
      "Mid-week moves on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday are typically cheaper than Friday or weekend moves, which carry a premium due to higher demand. Moving in January, February or March, outside the peak summer and end-of-month rush, also reduces the quote. If your completion date is flexible, ask for mid-week pricing when you request your survey.",
  },
  {
    question: "Man and van or full house removals: which should I choose?",
    answer:
      "Man and van is suited to studios, single rooms, student moves and small volumes of items. Full house removals are the right choice for 2-bedroom properties and above, for moves involving heavy or fragile items, or when packing is required. If you are unsure, our surveyor will recommend the appropriate service after assessing your property.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are my belongings insured during the house removal?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Public liability insurance and goods-in-transit insurance are included on every job without exception. Public liability covers damage caused to your property during the move. Goods-in-transit insurance covers your belongings from loading to delivery. If anything is damaged, there is a clear claims process with a financial remedy.",
  },
  {
    question: "What items will you not move?",
    answer:
      "We cannot transport gas cylinders, flammables, open chemicals, perishable food or live animals. Valuables such as jewellery, cash and passports should travel with you rather than in the removal vehicle. Gas appliances that need disconnecting or reconnecting are referred to a registered Gas Safe engineer.",
    answerAfter:
      "Your move coordinator will provide a full restricted-items list when you confirm your booking.",
  },
  {
    question: "How far in advance should I book a house removal in London?",
    answer:
      "For most moves, booking two to four weeks in advance is sufficient. Friday moves, end-of-month completions and moves in June, July and August book out earlier. Six to eight weeks ahead is advisable in peak season. For short-notice moves, call us directly; we keep capacity for urgent bookings where availability allows.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer packing and storage alongside the removal?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Professional packing (full or partial) and 24/7 CCTV-monitored storage are available as add-ons to any house removal. Storage is useful if there is a gap between your completion and move-in dates. Both services are quoted at the same time as the removal and included in the fixed written price.",

              Moving house in London is not like moving anywhere else. Parking suspensions take days
              to arrange. Narrow Victorian streets leave no room for a large vehicle. A fourth-floor
              flat without a lift adds hours to a move. Tight completion windows mean van hire and
              doing it yourself carries a real risk of running out of time.
            </p>
            <p>
              A trained, insured removal team removes each of those risks. Parking permits are
              arranged in advance by our operations team. Crew size and vehicle type are matched to
              your property after the survey. Fragile and heavy items including antiques, white goods and
              flat-pack furniture are packed, padded and loaded by people who do this every day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every job is covered by{" "}
              <strong>public liability insurance and goods-in-transit insurance</strong>. If
              something goes wrong, there is a clear claims process with a financial remedy, not an
              unenforceable verbal assurance.
            </p>
            <p>
              The result is a move that runs on time, with your belongings arriving intact and your
              energy spent on the things that matter on moving day.{" "}

            House removal costs in London vary by property size, access conditions, packing
            requirements and distance. A studio flat starts from about £200 plus VAT; a
            4 or 5-bedroom house reaches £2,000 to £3,000 plus VAT or more for a complex move.
            Indicative price bands by property size are shown below. Every price is subject to
            a free pre-move survey. No two moves are identical.

              whether packing is included and the chosen day of the week. A mid-week move in
              January can cost noticeably less than a Friday move at the end of June.{" "}

              Avoid Fridays, which carry a premium, and the last week of any month, when completion
              dates cluster. Moving in January, February or March is often cheaper than June,
              July or August. Ask when you request your quote: if your date is flexible, we will
              tell you the best available slot.
