    question: "How much does an office move cost in London?",

      "Office moves in London start from around £100 per workstation for a full-scale move with furniture, files and IT — though this is a generic guide figure. The total depends on crew size, IT complexity, furniture requirements, building access and any out-of-hours booking. A free on-site survey produces an accurate fixed-price quote with no hidden fees.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you move at the weekend or out of hours?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Out-of-hours and weekend office moves are a core part of the service. Evening and weekend slots allow the move to complete without disrupting business operations or requiring staff downtime during working hours. Confirm availability when you request a quote, or call 020 7205 2525 directly for urgent bookings.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you keep business downtime low?",
    answer:
      "Through sequencing. IT equipment is prioritised and packed first so systems can come back online at the new address as early as possible. Evening and weekend moves let staff arrive at a functional new office on the next working day. A move coordinator confirms the sequencing plan before move day.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you move our IT equipment and servers?",
    answer:
      "Yes. IT equipment, servers, comms room hardware and individual workstations are all handled by trained crews. Equipment is disconnected and bundled by your IT lead, packed in anti-static IT crates, transported and placed at the new address ready for reconnection. WEEE-compliant disposal is available for decommissioned hardware.",
    answerAfter: "See the IT and server relocation section for a full breakdown.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you dismantle and reassemble office furniture?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Desks, workstations, system furniture, storage units and office pods are dismantled at the current address and reassembled to the new floor plan. The surveyor confirms what needs dismantling and documents the destination layout at the on-site survey stage.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are you insured and accredited for office moves?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Full commercial goods-in-transit insurance and public liability cover are included on every booking, with tailored increased limits available for high-value moves. Top Removals is a member of BAR, NGRS, The Furniture Ombudsman, QSS-DW, Checkatrade and IAM. Certificates are available to view on the certificates page.",
    answerAfter: "Request copies of any certificate before confirming your booking.",
  },

    question: "Do you recycle old furniture and IT equipment?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Top Removals is a registered UK Environment Agency waste carrier. Decommissioned IT and electrical equipment is recycled to WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) standards. Office furniture clearance is available as part of the move or as a standalone service.",
    answerAfter: "See the rubbish disposal and office clearance page for more detail.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are red flags when hiring an office mover?",
    answer:
      "Red flags include: no written fixed-price quote, no goods-in-transit insurance confirmed in writing, no BAR or NGRS membership, no on-site survey offered before quoting, and no named move coordinator for your job. Request all policies and accreditation certificates before signing any booking.",
    bullets: [

      "No move coordinator named on your booking",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "Can you handle small offices as well as large?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The same managed process applies from a single-desk move to a 500-plus staff relocation. Small offices receive a dedicated move coordinator and a written fixed-price quote. No move is treated as a drop-in service; every booking is planned and confirmed in writing before move day.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide storage for office moves?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Business storage in a 24/7 CCTV-monitored London facility is available for phased moves, short-notice relocations or any job with a gap between moving out and moving in. Storage can be booked as part of the removal or as a standalone service.",

              An office removal is a managed commercial relocation covering the planning, packing,
              IT and server handling, furniture dismantling, transport and setup of a business at
              its new address. Every job is run by a named move coordinator whose role is to keep

              In 2026, office removals in London increasingly include out-of-hours and weekend
              moves, reflecting how businesses operate hybrid-working schedules. Scale ranges from a
              one-desk move to a 500-plus staff corporate relocation across multiple floors. For

              Lost productivity is the real cost of an office move. A 100-person office idle for
              even half a day represents a significant business cost — one that outweighs any saving
              from a cheaper mover. The way to keep downtime low is through sequencing, timing and
              a coordinator who owns the plan.
            </p>
            <p>
              Top Removals operates out-of-hours and weekend office moves so your team is not
              disrupted during working hours. Evening and weekend crews complete the physical move
              while the office is empty, so staff arrive at a functional new address on the next
              working day. IT equipment is prioritised throughout: it is packed first, loaded first
              and placed first at the new address so reconnection can begin immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
              Phased moves — where departments or floors are relocated in stages over multiple
              evenings or weekends — reduce disruption further for larger organisations. Interim
              storage is available for any items not moving in the first phase. A move coordinator
              is assigned to every job to manage the sequencing plan and act as a single point of
              contact throughout.

            <p>
              IT and server handling is the highest-risk element of any office move. Top Removals
              crews are trained to handle workstations, monitors, servers, UPS units, comms room
              hardware and specialist equipment. All items are moved using anti-static IT crates
              with cable bundles labelled and secured before packing.
            </p>
            <p>
              The process starts with your IT lead. Before packing, your IT team disconnects
              equipment to their own protocol; the crew packs and loads in the sequence your IT
              lead specifies. At the new address, IT equipment is unloaded and positioned first,
              giving your team the maximum window to reconnect and test systems before the
              business day starts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Decommissioned IT equipment — obsolete servers, monitors, printers and electrical
              devices — is collected and recycled to WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic
              Equipment) standards. Top Removals is a registered UK Environment Agency waste
              carrier, so disposal is documented and compliant.{" "}

              Office furniture ranges from standard desks and storage to bespoke system furniture,
              height-adjustable workstations and acoustic office pods. Top Removals crews dismantle,
              wrap and transport all of these, then reassemble to the new floor plan at the
              destination.{" "}

            <p>
              The surveyor documents what requires dismantling during the on-site survey and
              confirms the destination layout. This eliminates the delay caused by discovering
              mid-move that a piece of furniture will not fit through a lift or corridor at the
              new address. Items are padded with protective blankets throughout transit and
              reassembled directly to the agreed floor plan so your fit-out is ready from day one.

              A full-scale office move in London — covering furniture, files and IT — costs from
              around <strong>£100 per workstation</strong> as a generic guide, plus VAT at 20%.
              This figure varies significantly depending on the scope of the job. A one-desk move
              costs far less than a 50-person relocation with a comms room. The free on-site survey
              is the most accurate way to get a fixed price.

              Top Removals office removal crews cover all 32 London boroughs, Greater London and
              the UK. Commercial business districts served include the City of London, Canary Wharf,
              Mayfair, Shoreditch and Tech City, Victoria, Paddington Basin, Vauxhall, London
              Bridge and Hammersmith.
            </p>
            <p>
              Commercial building access in London is rarely straightforward. Managed buildings
              require goods lift bookings, loading bay reservations, and out-of-hours building
              management liaison — all arranged by the operations team in advance. Where the council
              requires a parking suspension for the loading vehicle, this is arranged with the
              relevant borough as part of move planning, typically 2 to 5 working days before
              move day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where a building management company or freeholder requires a method statement and risk
              assessment (RAMS) before granting access, Top Removals produces these as part of the
              pre-move planning process. Note this requirement at the survey stage and it will be
              included in the quote.
