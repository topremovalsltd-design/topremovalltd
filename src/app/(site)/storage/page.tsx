                London properties are compact. Spare rooms fill quickly. Many flats have no loft, no
                basement and no garage. When a move takes longer than expected, when a renovation
                empties a floor, or when an office is between locations, you need secure storage fast
                without the hassle of hiring a van, driving to a facility and loading it yourself.
              </p>
              <p>
                Top Removals solves that with a fully managed service. Our team collects from your
                address, loads your goods, seals the unit and stores it at our staffed Purfleet
                compound. When you need your belongings back, we return them to your door. No van
                hire, no heavy lifting, no access headaches.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2026, more London customers book managed storage than ever before, because the
                collect-and-store model is a genuine improvement over the traditional drive-up unit.
                You do not arrange transport, navigate a storage park or carry furniture up a ramp.
                We handle the physical work. As a certified member of the NGRS, we adhere to the
                strictest procedures to ensure your goods are in qualified hands.

              Storage at Top Removals starts at{" "}
              <strong className="text-brand-navy">£10 per week</strong>. Pricing is based on the
              volume of goods you store, not a fixed room size or square footage. You pay for the
              space your goods actually use.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is no minimum storage term and no maximum. Store for a single week between
              completion dates or for several years while you settle abroad. The rate is confirmed at
              the time of booking once we know your volume.
            </p>
            <p>
              Three factors affect your price: the volume of goods stored, the length of time you
              store, and whether we collect from your property or you deliver to our Purfleet
              facility. Delivery to the facility costs slightly less than a full collection service.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before storage, it pays to pack well. Plastic crates pack more efficiently than
              cardboard boxes and protect contents against moisture, particularly in long-term
              storage. Better packing reduces the volume you store and lowers your bill. See our{" "}
