/* ── FAQs ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */

const faqs: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    question: "Can you move just a few single items from a dormitory?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We move a single item, a few boxes or an entire room, including deliveries outside the UK. Send us the details of what needs moving and where it is going, and your move coordinator provides a quote. There is no minimum room size.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle books and paper for a dormitory move?",
    answer:
      "We offer eco lidded plastic crates for hire that seal completely and prevent water damage in transit. We deliver them to your dormitory ahead of collection and collect them afterwards. Plastic crates are stronger and more stackable than cardboard boxes, which is ideal for heavy books and paper files.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I access my belongings while they are in storage?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Your belongings are in your own unit with 24/7 CCTV surveillance. Give your move coordinator advance notice to arrange access. More items are added to your unit at any time by arrangement, and there is no time pressure on short or long-term bookings.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to be present during the collection?",
    answer:
      "No. Our movers pack and remove everything from your room without you there. Tell us what to pack and inform your dormitory so the crew gets access to the room. Give us the delivery or storage address and we handle the rest.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer international delivery for students moving abroad?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We pack your room for an international move and either deliver by truck or ship in a container, depending on the destination, with standard liability cover included and an open cover upgrade recommended. Customs clearance is handled through our international removals service.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a dormitory move or student storage cost?",
    answer:
      "Price depends on what needs packing, how far it is going, and whether you want delivery, shipping or storage. There are no hidden fees. Send your details to your move coordinator for a quote tailored to your room, destination and timeline.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer storage over the summer or between terms?",
    answer:
      "Yes, short and long-term storage with no time pressure. Summer storage, end of term storage and year abroad storage are all available. We collect from your dormitory and return your belongings to halls or a new address when you are ready.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you cover students across the UK?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We deliver to any point in the UK and Europe and ship worldwide, so we cover students at London universities and across the country. Collection is from your dormitory. Give us your address and destination to confirm the quote.",
