              Top Removals is a fully accredited moving company. We provide our customers with

                Top Removals was created a decade ago by two friends, Emil Perushanov and Dimitar
                Dimitrov. From the start, the goal was to become one of the best and most trusted
                moving companies in London. Their hard work has paid off, and the business has grown
                steadily since. Top Removals was featured in The Mover, one of the leading removals
                trade magazines.

              <p>
                Today the company is a proud member of BAR (British Association of Removers) and the
                NGRS (the National Guild of Removers and Storers). Top Removals closely follows their
                policies on customer service, insurance, safety and quality control. You can{" "}
