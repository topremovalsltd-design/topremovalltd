    question:
      "How is the price for packing/unpacking calculated and does it include the materials?",
    answer:
      "When estimating the price of the service, we take into consideration the method of packing, the number and type of materials that need to be used and the complexity of the whole procedure. When the customer books a complete service – packing, moving and materials, we can offer big discounts on the latter. As a rule of thumb, you can estimate the rate for the packing by multiplying the number of cartons needed by 6. So a 100 cartons pack job will cost approximately £600. This includes labour and all packing and wrapping materials – boxes, wrapping paper, bubble wrap, tape.",

    question: "Does the packing service come with full insurance?",

      "It includes packing all of the crockery, glassware, clothes, linen, lamps, books, pictures etc into cartons and marking the cartons for positioning them at your new home. If a customer has requested from us to do everything, we will come a day or two ahead of the scheduled loading date with all materials and complete the professional packing.",
