    question: "How much does an office relocation cost?",
    answer:
      "No two removal jobs are the same, that is why we often require assessment and take all factors into consideration when moving an office. A full-scale office move with furniture and files can cost an average of about £100 per working station or head. But this is a very generic number. We will be able to provide you with an estimate after the initial survey.",

      "If it can be lifted, dismantled and/or carried through the entry points, then it can be moved. This is Top Removals moto when it comes to commercial relocations. We are very careful when handling safes, servers and big copy machines. With the years of experience comes the knowledge of how to deal with all sorts of devices and equipment.",

const tips: Tip[] = [
  {
    title: "Wrap Your IT equipment carefully",
    body: "One of the most important things when organising an office relocation is to ensure the safety of data. So you need to invest in properly preparing your IT department for the move. All devices should be disconnected, and the cables must be bundled together. If you are packing them yourself, the IT equipment should be wrapped with anti-static bubble wrap and placed into an IT crate.",
  },
  {
    title: "Invest time in planning your budget",
    body: "Once you set your goals, spend some time planning how to finance them. Office removals often include additional expenses for cleaning, storage and packing materials. You need to find the best way to optimise your budget without breaking the bank. Discuss this with your moving coordinator. Top Removals can offer you a lot of different services and deals.",
  },
  {
    title: "Make sure everybody is on board with the relocation",
    body: "Before the arrival of the moving crew, you have to address all aspects of the move with your employees and especially with your managers. The two crucial figures for the execution of every commercial relocation are the HR manager and the head of IT. The first will help you divide the tasks and organise everybody. As for the IT experts, on their shoulders lay the hard task of getting your business back online, once the relocation is over. They will also have to closely work with the movers to ensure that the more delicate equipment is handled adequately.",
  },
  {
    title: "Consider hiring a storage unit",
    body: "If you are moving long-distance or on a very short notice, think about renting a storage unit. On one hand, your office inventory will be safely secured and under constant supervision. On the other, you will be able to relocate everything one step at a time. It will be more expensive to keep renting your former office space while preparing your new one than to hire a warehouse unit for a week or two. Top Removals can help you with that as well. We can offer you a 24/7 CCTV monitored storage facility in London, fitting your business' requirements.",

              It is a specialised service offered to businesses when they need to move their offices
              to a new location. They are different from house removals in terms of organisation,
              time, budget, packing methods and supplies. If your inventory can be dismantled or fit
              in moving crates, there are no restrictions to the size or type of organisations Top
              Removals can relocate.
