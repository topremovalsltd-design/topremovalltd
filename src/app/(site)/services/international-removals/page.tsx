const faqs: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    question: "How early in advance should I schedule an international move?",
    answer:
      "We recommend at least 2 weeks' notice for a long-distance relocation and even more for an international one. If you are planning to book a door-to-door international move, as opposed to a part-load service, then consider even a month or more notice. Bear in mind that often we suspend parking for the relocations we plan, and some local authorities require at least 2 weeks' notice for that. Changing the moving date in the last moment may result in losing the suspension bays and is subject to availability, although we do our best to accommodate all changes needed for our clients.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a part-load service?",
    answer:
      "Part-load service is a popular international removals service, where the customer doesn't move the entire household, but just a few items or boxes. It is done on the presumption that the client doesn't require a direct door-to-door, hence on one large international bound truck, we can load goods from several customers. Then the vehicle is routed, and the items are offloaded in a sequence. This is the cheapest service for international removals as the fuel and journey expenses are spread between a couple of clients allowing us to keep the rates low. As a disadvantage, the customer has to be flexible with the collection/delivery dates. A window for collection/delivery is given, and we can confirm the exact ETA with just a few days notice. According to international standards, any removal that answers the described requirements and can be completed within 14 days constitutes a part-load service.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I ship my stuff to another country?",
    answer:
      "Just give us a call and we will organise everything including the paperwork. Depending on where you want your goods to be transported to we can offer you different solutions. Top Removals have various partners around the world and can offer you both overseas shipping and airfreight. We will check the load and volume of your items and decide on the most budget-friendly option. In addition, we can also offer a single item delivery which means if you need to send a piano to Greece for example, we can do that for you.",
  },
];

const tips: Tip[] = [
  {
    title: "Familiarise with your destination country and its regulations",
    body: "You need to make sure all the things you want to transport are allowed to enter your destination country. This includes plants, pets, some firearms, medicines, etc. Your moving coordinator can help you with that. Check out our FAQ page to see what you should and shouldn't transport.",
  },
  {
    title: "Play it safe and bet on professional packing",
    body: "Moving to another country is not the same as relocating two blocks down from where you live right now. Your belongings must be carefully wrapped and prepared for the long transportation process. Everything must be properly padded and sealed. Usually, the best course of action is to hire professional packers, who know how to prep your items.",
  },
  {
    title: "Make an additional moving insurance",
    body: "Removal companies often provide you with a basic package of insurance services, however, this is often not enough. Everything happens and when it comes to international relocations a lot can go wrong. That is why Top Removals offers insurance upgrades to its customers. The open cover policy will guarantee extra protection for your valuables while travelling on foreign soil. Ask your moving coordinator to give you more details and think long and hard before you dismiss this option with a light hand.",
