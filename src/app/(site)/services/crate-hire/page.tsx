                The best way to minimise the environmental impact of your next office or house
                relocation and avoid cluttering your property with packing materials is by using
                plastic containers.
              </p>
              <p>
                As an eco-friendly moving company, we at Top Removals take our environmental
                responsibility seriously. Our crates are sturdy and durable, the material from which
                they are made allows them to be used safely multiple times. After every use, each one
                is properly disinfected and ready for its next customer.

              Crates are delivered a week or two prior to the scheduled move. We then collect them
              from the new address, when required. This can be on the day of the move, or a week or
              two after the completion. You can easily combine our crate hire with the man and van
              service for small volume move in the capital or the surrounding areas.
            </p>
            <p>
              We need to have signed acceptance of our offer and terms &amp; conditions prior to
              engaging in any services for any clients. The customers get a delivery note with the
              number of crates received and then a collection note for the number returned. This
              helps keep the inventory up to date and avoid losing any crates on the sites.
