As one of Londons top moving and storage companies, Top Removals can offer you premium packing materials and can even send a crew to wrap everything for you.",

    title: "Do not store food",

Avoid putting any kinds of foods (and living plants for that matter) in your boxes, as they can go bad very easily. Check with your coordinator to see which items you should skip packing.",

    title: "Consider renting a unit when you are moving",

They are especially handy when you are moving out of your dormitory. Since Top Removals has no limitations on the renting time, you can use these services as long as you need. Storage units will provide you with the extra time you will need to set your IT connections or get your utilities running.",
