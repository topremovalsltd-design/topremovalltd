    question: "Can you take my cat inside of the van for a short-distance move?",
    answer:
      "Even if it is for a short distance, it is dangerous for your animals to travel in the back of a moving vehicle. Try to arrange a pet sitter and pick them up after your belongings arrive at your new home. The safest solution is to just take your animal in the car with you. This way you can keep an eye on them at all times. There are also a couple of specialised companies that are licenced exclusively for pet transportation.",

    question: "I only need you to move my big wardrobe, can you do it?",
    answer:
      "Yes, the man and van service is extremely suitable for people who wish to move just one large piece of furniture or for students moving from their dormitory that have no other way of transporting a big wardrobe. Our movers are experienced in relocating musical instruments as well. We can come and safely wrap your piano or drum set and deliver it to its new home. Note that in these cases we are talking about a specialist's service as certain types of skills are required to move your items to any part of the British capital. As such there may be an additional fee.",

  {
    title: "How to make furniture dissemble faster?",
    body: "Simply find your furniture manuals. For more unusual or designer pieces, the user's instruction book will be essential, as it will save you a lot of time and stress. Make a mental note to put each manual in a zip-lock bag and label it. You can then collect all of them in a binder and use them to assemble the furniture, once it is unloaded at your new place.",
  },
  {
    title: "Consider Renting a Storage",
    body: "Hiring a unit is a great idea if you need to move out fast but you haven't already secured your new place. Top Removals can offer you transport to and from its London storage as a part of the Man and Van service, this way you don't have to extend the lease of your old place and lose money. Consider this possibility and discuss it with your moving coordinator prior to the booking of the Man and Van.",
  },
  {
    title: "Organise your boxes and belongings",
    body: "When packing, start from the things you rarely use and make your way towards your everyday essentials. If you own any antiques or valuable pieces inform your removals company. There is a right way to pack and transport such items in order to keep them undamaged. Furthermore, Top Removals can provide you with excellent rubbish disposal service for the items you no longer want or need like old furniture or electronics.",
  },
  {
    title: "Leave the lifting and loading to professionals",
    body: 'One of the biggest perks of the Man and Van services is you don\'t have to carry your boxes on your own. So leave this task to your movers and don\'t attempt to lift or load the van by yourself. There is a specific way of arranging the crates and on top of that, you can injure yourself if you don\'t use the proper gear. The thing you can do is label the boxes. Put signs stating "Fragile" to the crates containing your plates and glasses. Mark with "Heavy" the boxes which exceed 20 kg.',

              This is a removals service designed to help you with smaller, faster relocations in
              London or the surrounding areas. The man with a van usually involves one or two
              professional movers and is suited for up to two-bedroom houses. For bigger properties
              and longer moving distances, you should choose our house removal service.
