/* ─────────────── Section 13: FAQs ─────────────── */

const faqs: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    question: "How much does a man and van cost in London?",
    answer:
      "A man and van in London starts from £55 per hour (minimum 2 hours) for one mover and a van. Two movers start from £70 per hour and three movers from £90 per hour. Half-day and full-day rates reduce the effective hourly cost. The final price depends on crew size, van size, hours needed, distance and access conditions at both addresses.",
    answerAfter:
      "Use the removal calculator for an instant estimate, or request a free survey for a fixed written quote.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a minimum booking for a man and van in London?",
    answer:
      "The minimum booking is 2 hours. This covers the journey to you, the loading, the drive and the delivery. For most single-item jobs and short local moves, 2 hours is the right allowance. If you are unsure, describe the job when you request the quote and we will advise the correct time to book.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do man and van prices include fuel and mileage?",
    answer:
      "The hourly rate includes the driver, the van and standard loading time. Fuel and mileage within Greater London are included in the quoted rate. Congestion zone charges and Dartford crossing tolls apply as they arise on the specific route and are always confirmed in writing before the booking date. There are no hidden fees added on the day.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the cheapest day to book a man and van in London?",
    answer:
      "Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday are typically the most cost-effective days for a man and van booking. Fridays carry a premium due to high demand, and weekend rates may also be higher. End-of-month dates and the summer months from June to August book out early. If your date is flexible, ask when you request a quote and we will advise the best available slot.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is a man and van cheaper than a removal company?",
    answer:
      "For studios, bedsits and 1 to 2-bedroom flats, a man and van is almost always cheaper than a full house removal service. For larger homes or moves that require professional packing, a full removal crew is better value because the crew size, vehicle and planning are matched to the scale of the job. Using a man and van for a job that needs full removals typically costs more in crew hours than the rate difference saves.",
    answerAfter: "See the man and van versus full removals guide further down this page.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are my belongings insured with a man and van service?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Goods-in-transit insurance is included in the quoted rate and covers your belongings from loading to delivery. Public liability insurance covers damage caused to your property during the move. Both policies are active on every booking without exception. If something is damaged, there is a clear claims process rather than an unenforceable verbal assurance.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you move a single item or a piano?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The man and van service is well suited to single-item moves: a sofa, a bed, a wardrobe, a fridge or a dining table. Pianos and musical instruments can also be moved; specialist crews using piano boards and skates are used for upright and grand pianos. Piano moves are quoted as a specialist service and may carry an additional fee. A free quote covers the full cost before you commit.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you come the same day?",
    answer:
      "Yes, subject to crew and vehicle availability. Same-day and short-notice slots are kept available each day for urgent bookings. To check same-day availability call 020 7205 2525 directly for the fastest response. The online quick quote form is also available and we aim to call back within the hour for short-notice requests.",
  },
  {
    question: "What van size do I need?",
    answer:
      "A small or medium van covers single items, light loads and studios. A Luton van is the right choice for 1 to 2-bedroom flats and any job with larger furniture or a full property load. If you are unsure, describe the move when you request a quote: we will recommend the correct vehicle after reviewing the volume, access and distance for your specific job.",
    answerAfter: "See the van size and crew guide further up this page for a move-type breakdown.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you arrange parking permits for a man and van?",
    answer:
      "Yes. If a permit zone or council-managed loading bay prevents the van from parking close to your property, our operations team arranges a borough parking suspension in advance. Council parking suspensions typically require 2 to 5 working days to arrange. Let us know about any access restrictions when you request your quote and we will handle it.",

              A man and van service in London provides a professional driver, a fully equipped van
              and optional loading and unloading help, billed by the hour. Crew size and van size are
              matched to your move: a small or medium van with one mover suits a single item or
              studio flat; a Luton van with two movers covers 1 and 2-bedroom flats comfortably.

              In 2026, the typical London man and van booking covers furniture collections, student
              moves, single-item deliveries, marketplace collections and part-loads that do not
              justify a full removal crew. For properties of three bedrooms or more, or for moves

              Man and van vs self-drive van hire

            <p className="mt-2 text-sm leading-relaxed text-brand-charcoal/85">
              A man and van includes the professional driver and the lifting. Self-drive van hire
              requires you to drive, load and unload yourself. When the cost of van hire, fuel,
              insurance, a second driver and physical labour is added up, a man and van is often
              cheaper, and removes all physical risk. This is especially true for any job involving
              heavy furniture or stairs.

              Top Removals man and van crews cover all 32 London boroughs, Greater London and
              surrounding areas including Surrey, Essex and Kent. Nationwide moves are also handled
              with the same fixed-price process.{" "}

            <p>
              London access is rarely straightforward. Our operations team arranges borough council
              parking suspensions where a permit zone prevents the van from stopping near the
              property. Narrow Victorian streets, managed buildings with goods lifts and top-floor
              flats without a lift are all assessed at the survey stage and factored into the crew
              time estimate. ULEZ and congestion zone charges are flagged in the written quote for
              the specific route.
