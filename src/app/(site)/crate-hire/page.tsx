      "These two crate types cover around 90 percent of office packing requirements. Other sizes are sourced on request. Tell us your specific requirements and we confirm what is available and quote accordingly.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you hire crates for an international relocation?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Crates are available for international moves. Your coordinator advises on the right type and quantity for the job. Delivery and collection are arranged around the move schedule, with delivery and collection notes to keep the inventory accurate throughout.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I hire crates if I live outside London?",
    answer:
      "Crate hire is focused on London and the surrounding area. Delivery and collection are priced by the congestion-zone tiers shown on this page. Contact us with your postcode and we confirm whether your address is within our service area and quote the delivery cost.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does crate hire cost?",
    answer:
      "LC3 crates are £2.00 per week, IT crates are £3.80 per week, all prices plus VAT at 20%. Delivery and collection are charged separately by crate quantity and congestion zone. See the price tables on this page for the full breakdown.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long is the hire period?",
    answer:
      "Crates are delivered a week or two before your scheduled move. Collection is arranged from your new address on move day or up to a week or two after completion. The period is flexible around your move dates. Speak to your coordinator at booking to confirm the exact timeline.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does delivery and collection work?",
    answer:
      "Delivery and collection are charged by the number of crates and whether the address is inside or outside the London congestion zone. You receive a delivery note listing the crates received and a collection note confirming the number returned. Both notes keep the inventory accurate.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are plastic crates better than cardboard boxes for moving?",
    answer:
      "For a local London move, plastic crates are faster to pack, reusable and leave no cardboard waste at the destination. They are lidded, waterproof and sealable. Cardboard boxes suit postal or one-way long-distance moves where return collection is not practical.",

                The best way to reduce the environmental impact of a local move is to avoid
                single-use cardboard altogether. Plastic crates are reused many times. Each one
                is disinfected after every hire, returned to our depot and back in service for
                the next job. No cardboard to break down, no waste to recycle, no clutter at
                the destination.

                Top Removals hires LC3 and IT crates for London home and office moves,
                delivered to your address before the move and collected from the new address
                when you are ready. The service is available as a standalone hire or combined
                with any of our removal services.
