    question: "How much does a packing service cost in London?",

      "As a rule of thumb, you can estimate the rate for the packing by multiplying the number of cartons needed by 6. So a 100-carton pack job will cost approximately £600. This includes labour and all packing and wrapping materials: boxes, wrapping paper, bubble wrap, tape. The exact total depends on scope, fragile content and any specialist handling. A free survey produces an accurate fixed quote.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is included in the full packing service?",
    answer:
      "It includes packing all of the crockery, glassware, clothes, linen, lamps, books, pictures and so on into cartons and marking the cartons for positioning them at your new home. If a customer has requested us to do everything, we will come a day or two ahead of the scheduled loading date with all materials and complete the professional packing.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does the packing service come with full insurance?",
    answer:
      "Yes, everything we handle is covered by the insurance we hold. Speak to your moving coordinator about the different insurance options and policies available to you, depending on your destination.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you supply all packing materials?",
    answer:
      "Yes. All boxes, bubble wrap, wrapping paper and tape are included in the quoted price for a full packing booking. Nothing is charged separately for these materials. Mattress covers and sofa covers are available as paid add-ons. If you prefer to pack yourself, materials can be ordered separately through our packaging materials service.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many boxes do I need for my home?",
    answer:
      "A studio flat typically needs 25 to 35 boxes. A 1-bedroom flat needs around 35 to 50. A 2-bedroom flat requires 50 to 75, and a 3-bedroom house around 75 to 110. The exact quantity is confirmed at the survey, as volume varies significantly depending on how much has accumulated in the property over the years.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does professional packing take?",
    answer:
      "A studio flat takes 2 to 3 hours for two packers. A 1-bedroom flat takes 3 to 5 hours. A 2-bedroom flat takes 5 to 7 hours. A 3-bedroom house typically takes a full day. Times increase when fragile or specialist items need extra wrapping. Three packers reduce times by roughly a third.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you pack fragile items and antiques?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Fragile items, antiques, artwork and glassware are packed using acid-free paper, an extra layer of bubble wrap, and a strict crating procedure. Our crews are trained in specialist fragile packing. High-value pieces can be noted at the survey stage so the appropriate protection method and crate type is confirmed in advance.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I choose partial packing for selected rooms only?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Partial packing covers selected rooms, specific item types, or a single category such as kitchen glassware or bedroom wardrobes. You pack everything else yourself. Partial packing is quoted separately and can be booked as a standalone service or as an add-on to any removal.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer an unpacking service?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The unpacking service places contents in the correct rooms, removes all packing waste and disposes of it responsibly. Top Removals is a registered UK Environment Agency waste carrier, so all cardboard, bubble wrap and paper is collected and recycled. Unpacking is quoted as an add-on to any packing booking.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is it worth hiring professional packers?",
    answer:
      "Professional packing saves time and reduces the risk of breakage. It is worth it when you have fragile or high-value items, a large property, a tight moving timeline, or where your insurance policy requires professional packing for full liability cover. For small, low-value loads, a materials and consultation booking may be a better fit.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you recycle packing waste after unpacking?",
    answer:
      "Yes. All packing materials, including cardboard boxes, bubble wrap, paper and tape, are collected after unpacking and recycled under Top Removals' UK Environment Agency waste carrier registration. No landfill. All waste is documented and disposed of responsibly.",

            <p className="mt-6 text-base leading-relaxed text-brand-charcoal/85">
              A professional packing service means trained crews arrive at your property with all
              materials, pack every item methodically, label each box for room placement, and leave
              with waste after unpacking. In 2026 a full-service London packing job typically covers
              crockery, glassware, clothes, linen, books, lamps, pictures and furniture, everything
              from the smallest ornament to the largest wardrobe, delivered clearly labelled and ready
              to unpack.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-brand-charcoal/85">
              The difference from DIY is speed, materials quality, and insurance: Top Removals crews
              pack faster because it is their daily trade, use quality boxes and specialist crating,
              and all items they handle are covered under goods-in-transit insurance. For fragile, antique, or high-value items the gap in
              protection is significant.
