  },
  {
    question: "I am not sure what I will need. Can you help?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Tell us your property size and what you are moving, and we advise on quantities. For an exact count, book our packing service and the team brings and uses the right materials for your move. A video or on-site survey confirms everything before any materials are ordered.",

    question: "Is there a minimum order quantity?",

  },
  {
    question: "How many boxes do I need for a move?",
    answer:
      "It depends on property size and what you own. As a starting guide, a one-bedroom flat needs roughly 20 to 40 boxes; a 3-bedroom house needs 60 or more. Books and kitchens mean more small boxes; bedrooms mean large and wardrobe boxes. An exact count is confirmed at a free survey.",

    question: "What are the delivery options and cost?",

      "Delivery is free on orders over £120. A £20 delivery charge applies to all other orders. A congestion charge fee applies on certain London routes. Flat-packed materials are also available for UK customers outside London who are using our services. All prices are plus VAT at 20%.",

    question: "Do removal companies provide packing boxes?",
