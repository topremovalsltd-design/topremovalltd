              An essential part of the moving services is the vehicles, each year we change or add a
              couple. This makes it possible to renew our fleet entirely within 3 years. Which means
              we always run new, modern, environmentally friendly and advanced vehicles. In addition,
              Top Removals has a contract with a couple of rental companies and can increase the fleet
              in times of need, usually during the summer.
            </p>
            <p>As of 2020, our fleet consists of the following types of vehicles:</p>

              All vans and trucks are equipped with advanced systems in the cab, which includes
              navigation, real-time warning when changing direction, air suspension for a smooth ride
              and reverse cameras. The large trucks are with dual sleeper cabs, offering the best
              possible environment for the long-haul drivers. Each van and truck is also equipped with
              all sorts of packing and cushioning materials. There is also lifting gear like straps,
              bars, trolleys and skates and a wide range of tools and drills. This way our movers can
              handle every unexpected situation they may run into adequately and efficiently.

              There is no limit for the number of boxes and goods as long as the vehicles won&apos;t
              exceed their permissible gross weight. And if you are relocating a large office with a
              big inventory, we will just use a couple of trucks or vans to deliver the services.
