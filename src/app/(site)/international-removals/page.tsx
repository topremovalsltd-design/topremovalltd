const faqs: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    question: "How early should I schedule an international move?",
    answer:
      "Allow at least 2 weeks notice for a long-distance move, and more for international. For a dedicated door-to-door service rather than a part-load, allow a month or more. Parking suspensions often require 2 weeks notice from local authorities. Changing your date at short notice risks losing reserved suspension bays and is subject to availability.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a part-load service?",
    answer:
      "A part load shares container or vehicle space with other consignments travelling the same route, lowering the cost for smaller moves. The trade-off is a wider delivery window rather than a fixed date. A full load gives you a dedicated vehicle or container with confirmed collection and delivery dates. Any move that shares space and is completed within 14 days meets the international part-load standard.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I ship my belongings to another country?",
    answer:
      "Book a survey, we quote and confirm the scope, then pack and load your goods. Your coordinator handles customs documentation and all required paperwork. We ship by road on our own fleet for European destinations, or by sea or air via our partner network for worldwide moves. Your goods are delivered door to door at your destination.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much do international removals cost?",
    answer:
      "Cost depends on volume, destination and distance, shipping method, part load versus full load, packing scope and insurance. No fixed figure is accurate without a survey. A free survey confirms the exact scope and a written fixed quote is issued before any commitment is made.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which countries do you cover?",
    answer:
      "Weekly road services to Scandinavia, Norway, Germany, Switzerland, Benelux and Austria on our own fleet. Bi-weekly services to Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Wider Europe and worldwide destinations including the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, China, South Africa and the UAE via our partner network and sea or air freight.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are my belongings insured during an international move?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Basic goods-in-transit insurance is included in every international booking. An open cover policy upgrade is available for additional protection on high-value items throughout the international journey. Your coordinator explains both options at the survey stage.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you handle customs and documentation?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Your assigned moving coordinator handles country and customs information, inventory documentation and all required paperwork for your destination. For complex relocations involving immigration or Visa requirements, your coordinator provides guidance and connects you with the appropriate services.",
  },
  {
    question: "What items cannot be shipped internationally?",
    answer:
      "Restricted and prohibited items vary by destination country. Plants, live animals, certain medicines, firearms, ammunition, flammable items, pressurised canisters and food products are commonly restricted. Your coordinator confirms what qualifies for your specific destination before packing begins.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does an international delivery take?",
    answer:
      "Delivery time depends on destination and shipping method. European road services run on weekly and bi-weekly schedules, which reduces waiting time significantly. Worldwide sea freight typically takes 4 to 12 weeks depending on destination. Airfreight is faster. Your coordinator confirms the expected timeframe at the survey stage.",

                In 2026, more London households and businesses use international removal specialists
                rather than coordinating freight independently. Customs documentation, insurance and
                logistics complexity all carry real risk when managed without professional oversight.

              Your coordinator handles country and customs information, produces the inventory, manages
              the documentation for your destination and keeps you updated at each stage. For moves
              involving immigration and Visa requirements, your coordinator provides guidance and
              connects you with the appropriate professional resources.
            </p>
            <p>
              This coordination is included in every international booking, not an optional extra.
              It is one of the most significant practical differences between using a professional
              international mover and arranging freight independently.

              Basic goods-in-transit insurance is included in every international booking. This
              covers your belongings against standard transit risk from loading to delivery.
            </p>
            <p>
              For international moves, the open cover policy upgrade is available and recommended
              for any move that includes high-value items, antiques, artwork, electronics or
              irreplaceable pieces. The open cover policy extends protection throughout the
              international journey and provides higher declared values where the standard cover
              limit is insufficient.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ask your coordinator to explain the difference between basic cover and the open cover
              upgrade at the survey stage, before you confirm the scope. Insurance decisions are
              easier to make before packing begins.
